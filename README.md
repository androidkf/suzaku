# Suzaku UI framework

## Motto

> Suzaku helps developers create beautiful, functional and efficient user interfaces for mobile and web platforms.
> It's easy, fun and safe to use and lets developers work purely in Scala.

## Status

Suzaku is currently in *experimental* stage, going through a lot of changes and improvements. It's not quite ready for
building applications but contributors are most welcome!

Please read through the [Contributor documentation](doc/contributor/README.md) !

## Presentations

You can find a few presentations on Suzaku, focusing mostly on the why, not that much on what or how :)
